</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image007.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF any one had told Sam Franklin before he
married that he would ever save money out of his
wages, he would have laughed the idea to scorn; they
had never been more than enough when he had only
himself to keep, and when there was a wife into the
bargain, what chance would there be for him to have
a penny to put by? Yet, before he had been a husband
many weeks, he had made the discovery that
the wages which had only been enough for one were
rather more than enough for two. There were no
dinners at the cookshops to be paid for, no long
evenings spent in the public-houses, no laundresses&#8217;
bills to meet. He had a great deal more comfort
with a somewhat smaller outlay.</p>

<p>When Sam found half-a-crown in his pocket over
and above the sum he allowed his wife for housekeeping
and rent, he hardly knew what to do with it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
His own fireside was very comfortable, and he did
not care to leave it for the tavern. He and his wife
were living on the first-floor of a house in a decent,
quiet street, mostly occupied by artisans like himself,
though the houses were from three to four stories high,
and had been built for richer people. They had a
sitting-room, with a bedroom behind it, and the use
of a back kitchen for cooking and washing; so the
place was quite large enough for comfort. Ann
Franklin had notions of cleanliness and smartness,
which made her take great pride in herself and all her
belongings. The parlour, as she liked it to be called,
was kept bright and cheerful, and that man must have
had a strange idea of comfort who preferred the noise
and smoke of a public-house taproom.</p>

<p>What, then, was Sam to do with his spare half-crown?
It doubled itself into five shillings, and by-and-by
a golden half-sovereign lay among the silver
and copper he carried loose in his pocket. He was
a man of few words&mdash;a close man, his comrades
called him&mdash;and silent as the grave concerning his
own affairs. Had he told one of them when he was
about to be married? Not his best friend amongst
them! Had he mentioned it as a piece of news
interesting to himself that he had a son born? Never!
He despised men who could not keep a still tongue in
their heads, but must prate about all they did or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
thought. Even with his wife he was sparing of words,
though he liked her to tell him everything she did,
and keep no secret from him. But then Ann was
only a woman; a man should have more control over
his tongue.</p>

<p>So Sam Franklin did not say a word about his
savings, though they seemed to grow like seed sown
in good ground. Every week he gave his wife the
sum they had first agreed upon, and she made the
best of it cheerfully, letting him know how every
penny was spent, and sometimes wondering to him
how his comrades&#8217; wives managed to be so much
smarter than she was. At first he had thoughts of
buying her a new bonnet or shawl, but he scarcely
liked to own that he had been keeping back the
money from her. This difficulty became greater as
the sum grew larger; and, besides that, the possession
of it began to get a hold upon him. It gave to him
a secret consciousness of wealth among his fellow-workmen,
which was very pleasant for a time; but
by-and-by this feeling passed away, and a strange,
unaccountable dread of being poor took possession of
him. He began to talk about bad times, and the
high prices of provisions and clothing, and the expenses
of a family, though his own consisted of his
cheery, managing wife, and one boy only. But this
change in Sam Franklin was so gradual, that neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
himself nor his wife had any idea what was going on.
He spent his evenings at home, and went nearly every
Sunday to the place of worship which Ann and
Johnny constantly attended. Ann was very proud
of her tall, fine-looking husband, whose clothes she
kept in such good order that he looked, in her eyes
at least, quite a gentleman. No one had a word to
say against him, though if it had been otherwise, Ann
was too true a wife to let it be said in her presence.
He was industrious and steady, and kind to her and
the boy; and if she had to work hard to keep them
both tidy and respectable, why, it was the fault of the
bad times, not her husband&#8217;s.</p>

<p>When Sam Franklin had saved ten pounds, and
had two Bank of England notes to take care of, his
difficulty and perplexity had very much increased.
There was no Post-office Savings-bank, and he had
no faith in the old savings-banks, for he could remember
how his poor old mother had lost every penny of
her painful savings by the breaking of the one she
had put her money into. He dare not tell Ann about
it, after keeping such a secret so long. The money became
a trouble to him, though perhaps it was his
most cherished possession. Certainly he thought of it
oftener than of Ann or Johnny, for wherever he hid it,
it could not but be a source of anxiety to him. If he
took it to the work-yard with him he was fearful of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
losing it, whilst if he left it at home he was quite as
much alarmed lest Ann should find it. How it would
alter the face of things if she discovered that he was
the owner of all that money, and had never told her!</p>

<p>At length, when his savings mounted up to twenty
pounds, a bright idea struck him one day. He stayed
at home the next Sunday evening, and having found
his old wedding waistcoat, which was lined with a
good strong linen lining, he carefully unpicked a part
of one of the seams large enough to take in a folded
bank-note, and spread them as high as he could reach
with his finger up and down the breast of it. He
could not stitch it up again as neatly as it had been
sewn before, but he was obliged to trust to Ann not
noticing it, for it was a worn-out waistcoat and past
her regard altogether: yet when she came home the
first thing she saw was that he had it on with his coat
buttoned across it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good gracious, Sam!&#8217; she cried, &#8216;whatever made
you put on that old thing?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s warmer than any I&#8217;ve got,&#8217; he answered,
putting his hand up against the breast of it where the
bank-notes lay safe and hidden.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s so old-fashioned,&#8217; she said, discontentedly;
&#8216;but it doesn&#8217;t matter much if you won&#8217;t go out of
doors in it. Men have no notion of things.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8216;What was the text, Ann?&#8217; he inquired, simply
to turn away her attention from the old waistcoat.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! it hadn&#8217;t anything to do with us,&#8217; she replied,
more cheerfully; &#8216;it was, &#8216;The love of money is the
root of all evil.&#8217; Nothing for us in that, you know,
though the preacher did say we might love it as much
from craving after it as having it. Well, I neither have
it, nor crave it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Sam felt uncomfortable, and did not make any
further remark. He told his wife he should always
put on his old waistcoat when he came in from his
work; and he continued to do so regularly for some
time, then occasionally, until after awhile the waistcoat
simply hung on a nail behind the bedroom door,
only being taken down once a week by Ann, to have the
dust brushed from it. Every now and then he had
another note to add to those he had already secured;
and he became so skilled in opening and sewing the
seam, that there was no fear of Ann noticing any
difference. Even yet he would wear it upon a rainy
Sunday, feeling a deep satisfaction in his admirable
scheme for concealing and taking care of his savings.</p>

<p>Month after month, and year after year, the old
waistcoat kept his secret faithfully. His eyes rested
upon it first thing in the morning and last thing at
night, hanging behind the door, as if it would hang
there for ever. He grew more stingy then ever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
grudging his wife her bits of blue and pink ribbon,
with which she made herself smart, and altogether
refused to send Johnny to a school where the fee was
sixpence a week, instead of the threepence he had
paid hitherto at a dame&#8217;s-school. He was longing to
make up fifty pounds; he had already forty-five in
his waistcoat, and how much more fifty pounds
sounded than forty-five!</p>

<p>He had between three and four pounds towards
this very desirable end, when one night, upon his return
from work, he went as usual into the back room
to wash his hands and face, and glanced at once towards
the familiar object behind the door. But it was
not there! The place was bare, and the nail empty.
The mere sight of an empty nail in that place filled
him with terror; but no doubt Ann had laid it away
in some drawer. His voice, as he called to her, was
broken and tremulous.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where have you put my old waistcoat?&#8217; he asked.
He could hear her pouring the boiling water over the
tea in the next room, and she did not answer before
clicking down the lid of the teapot.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, it was only harbouring the dust,&#8217; she answered,
in a cheerful voice, &#8216;so I made a right good
bargain, and sold it for ninepence to an old-clothesman.&#8217;</p>

<p>The shock was so sudden that Sam staggered as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
if he had received a heavy blow, and fell on the floor.
He did not quite lose his senses, for he felt Ann
trying to lift him up, and heard her asking what ailed
him. In a minute or two he managed to get up and
sit down on the foot of the bed, but still he found
himself giddy and stunned.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where is it?&#8217; he cried, bursting into tears and
sobs, like a child; &#8216;where is it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The old waistcoat?&#8217; she asked, thinking he was
gone out of his mind.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes!&#8217; he said. &#8216;There was nine five-pound notes
in it; forty-five pounds in Bank of England notes!&#8217;</p>

<p>At first Ann thought his head had been hurt by
his fall, and he was rambling; but as he kept on
moaning over his loss, and confessing how he had
concealed the notes from her, she began to believe
him, and all the sooner when he pulled out the three
sovereigns he had saved towards the tenth note and
flung them on the floor in angry despair.</p>

<p>&#8216;And I don&#8217;t know the man from Adam!&#8217; cried
Ann. &#8216;I never saw him before; and he&#8217;ll take very
good care I never see him again. Oh, Sam! how
could you? how could you keep it a secret all these
years, when I never bought as much as a yard of
ribbon or a collar on the sly? I can&#8217;t forgive it, or
forget it either.&#8217;</p>

<p>She felt it very hard that Sam should not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
trusted her. The loss of the money was hard, and
she could not help thinking what a large sum it was,
and what it might have done for Johnny. But the
loss of faith in her husband was ten times worse.
How could she ever believe in him again? or how
could she ever be sure again that he really loved and
trusted her?</p>

<p>It was a very miserable evening. Sam bewailed
his money so bitterly that Ann began to fancy he
would rather have lost her or his child. She sat silent
and indignant, whilst he, unlike himself, was almost
raving with angry sorrow. She did not speak to him
the next morning before he set off to the yard,
though she knew he had lain awake all night like
herself, and had not swallowed a morsel of breakfast.
It was a cold, wintry day, with a drizzling mist filling
the air. Sam was wet through before he reached his
work, and there was no chance of drying his clothes.
He was wet through when he came home, but there
were no dry, warm things laid out for him. He
might wait upon himself, thought Ann; it would be
well for him to see the difference between a good wife
and a bad one. He would not condescend to find a
change of clothing for himself, and he sat shivering
on the hearth all night, in spite of the warm, cheerful
blaze of the bright fire.</p>

<p>By the time the week was ended, Sam Franklin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
was compelled to knock off work. Severe rheumatic
fever had set in, and the doctor said he must not
expect to get back to the yard for three months or
more. Perhaps it was the best thing that could have
befallen him, for it brought back all the old warm
love for him to his wife&#8217;s heart, which had been
grieved and estranged by his closeness and want of
trust in her. She nursed him tenderly, never saying
a word to blame him now he could not get out of her
way, as many wives would have done. Before his
illness was half over she was forced to pawn all her
own best clothing, as well as his, to buy the mere
necessaries of life. Never had Sam Franklin thought
his wife would have to go day after day to the pawn-shop;
but she did it so cheerfully that half of the
sting of it was taken away.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nancy,&#8217; he said, one morning, &#8216;all night long
I&#8217;ve had a text ringing in my head, &#8216;You cannot
serve God and mammon,&#8217; &#8216;You cannot serve God and
mammon!&#8217; Why, I used to think I was doing God
a service when I put on my Sunday clothes and went
to church of a Sunday morning with you. As if
He&#8217;d think that were serving Him! And then all the
week I was worshipping that old waistcoat of mine
hanging behind the door, as much as any poor
heathen worships blocks of wood and stone. I
begin to think it was God who put it in your heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
to sell it to the old-clothesman. But how can I
serve Him now, Nancy, my girl? I can&#8217;t do anything
save lie in this bed and be a burden to you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ann Franklin stooped down and kissed her husband,
whispering, &#8216;I don&#8217;t mind a bit about you
being a burden, as you call it;&#8217; and after that she
opened a Bible and read these words: &#8216;Then said
they unto him, What shall we do, that we may work
the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto
them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him
whom he hath sent.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay! I see it,&#8217; he said, after a long pause, &#8216;that&#8217;s
a work I can begin better here, perhaps, than in the
yard at my work. I can work for God that way,
lying here on my back as helpless as a baby. And
now I come to think of it, Jesus Christ never served
mammon anyway, and if I believe in Him I shall try
to be like Him. It&#8217;s no use praying to God on Sundays
and doing contrary all the week, wailing after
money and such like.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sam,&#8217; answered his wife, &#8216;I&#8217;ve not been believing
in him as I ought, for I&#8217;ve been fretting after that old
waistcoat ever so, thinking how useful the money
would be now; but if you&#8217;ll help me I&#8217;ll help you,
and we&#8217;ll try to believe in Him just the same as if we
could see him coming into the room and talking
to us.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8216;But that would be seeing, not believing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So it would,&#8217; she answered, &#8216;and he said himself,
&#8220;Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.&#8221;
We must trust in Him without seeing Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>But it was a hard trial to trust in God whilst all
their possessions were disappearing one after another.
Sam was a long while in fully recovering his strength;
and when he was fit to go back to the yard they were
pretty deeply in debt. Yet never had they been so
happy in former days. Their simple faith in the
Saviour gave them a peace different from anything
they had ever felt before; and Sam, who had now no
secret care or pleasure to brood over in his own mind,
grew frank and open with his wife. They pinched
and denied themselves to get out of debt; and when
the next winter came they were again in the comfortable
circumstances which had been theirs when Ann
sold the valuable old waistcoat.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sam,&#8217; said Ann, a day or two before Christmas-day,
&#8216;Johnny&#8217;s been putting threepence a week into
the school club. He&#8217;s got as much as nine shillings
in, and he&#8217;s to have twopence a shilling added to it
if we buy him clothes with it, but we can have the
nine shillings out if we like. Come home in time to
go with us to the school to-night.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay!&#8217; said Sam, heartily, &#8216;I&#8217;ll go with Johnny
to get his little fortune.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>It was quite dark in the evening when the three
started off for the school where the weekly pence
were paid in. But as they locked their parlour-door
and turned into the street, they saw a girl about
Johnny&#8217;s age, with bare feet and no bonnet on her
head, standing on the outer door-sill, shivering and
crying, as she looked at the dismal night, with flakes
of snow drifting lazily in the air. They all knew her
well; she was the little girl belonging to the tenant
of the attic two floors above them. Ann had often
given fragments of bread and meat to Johnny to take
to her, but she had always shrunk from inviting her
into their parlour, because she was too dirty and
ragged. Now, as the child stood crying and shivering
on the door-step, her heart smote her for her
want of kindness, and she stopped to speak to her
gently.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Father says I must go and beg,&#8217; she answered,
crying more bitterly, &#8216;and I&#8217;m frightened, and it&#8217;s so
bitter cold. But we must pay our rent, he says, or
be turned out, and he doesn&#8217;t know where to go to,
and is very ill, coughin&#8217; ever so. We owe for three
weeks now, that&#8217;s nine shillings, and I don&#8217;t know
where I&#8217;m to beg for nine shillings.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s all the coppers I&#8217;ve got,&#8217; said Sam
putting three or four pence in her hand, and hurrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
on with Ann and Johnny, whilst the girl pattered after
them, with her bare feet tingling in the snow. Ann
did not speak again till they reached the school, but
once or twice she looked back and saw the little
ragged figure following them. There was no one in
the school room except themselves and the gentleman
who was ready to receive their payment and give
them the ticket for buying clothes to the value of
ten shillings and sixpence. But before he could write
out the ticket Ann glanced round, and saw a thin,
care-worn little face peering in through the window.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Sam,&#8217; she cried, &#8216;we don&#8217;t want it so badly
after all, and I think if it belonged to Him, Jesus
Christ, he would give it to the poor man up in the
attic to pay his rent with. Don&#8217;t you think he
would?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But it&#8217;s Johnny&#8217;s little fortune,&#8217; said Sam, &#8216;and we
should lose one and sixpence if we took it out for that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Johnny &#8217;ud be glad to give it to poor little
Bell?&#8217; asked Ann, with her hand on the boy&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, mother, for little Bell,&#8217; he said readily.</p>

<p>&#8216;Johnny&#8217;s clothes are warm, if they&#8217;re shabby,&#8217;
pursued Ann, &#8216;and there&#8217;s that poor little creature in
rags, and barefoot. My heart aches for her, Sam.
If it were our boy, and they&#8217;d nine shillings they
didn&#8217;t want badly, what should we like them to do?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8216;Well, Ann, I give up,&#8217; he said; &#8216;after all, it&#8217;s your
savings, not mine.&#8217;</p>

<p>Still he was not quite satisfied about it. That
man in the attic was very probably a drunken vagabond,
and deserved to be turned out for not paying
his rent. To be sure he had been a tenant nearly a
year, and had been quiet enough, meddling with nobody,
and not putting himself in anybody&#8217;s way.
Sam had not seen him above two or three times, and
then he had only just caught sight of a thin, stooping
figure, with a shabby old coat buttoned up to the throat,
as if the man had no shirt to wear. Anyhow it was
Ann&#8217;s business, and if any wife deserved to have her
own way in a thing like this, it was his wife.</p>

<p>Ann picked up the money, which was counted out
to her, with a pleasant smile upon her face. It was
snowing very fast when they opened the school-room
door; but there was little Bell still, with her face
pressed against the window and one foot drawn up
out of the snow to keep it warmer. Ann called to her,
and she ran quickly towards them.</p>

<p>&#8216;I prayed to God for the money this morning,&#8217; she
said, looking wistfully up into Ann&#8217;s smiling face, &#8216;but
He couldn&#8217;t have heard me, for He never sent it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s going to send it now,&#8217; answered Ann.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will an angel come with it?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay!&#8217; answered Sam, stooping down and lifting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the child in his arms, for he was quite strong again,
and she was too thin and puny to be much weight.
He did not like to see her bare feet on the snow, and
if Ann was going to do them a good turn, why should
he not do another?</p>

<p>&#8216;An angel with shining, white clothes on, and
wings?&#8217; said little Bell.</p>

<p>&#8216;No; she&#8217;s wearing an old bonnet and a faded
shawl,&#8217; answered Sam, &#8216;and her wings aren&#8217;t grown
yet, I&#8217;m glad to say.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;For shame, Sam!&#8217; cried his wife; but she was
glad to hear from his voice that he was agreeing
heartily with her self-denial. It was not far back to
their home, but instead of turning into their own
pleasant room they all marched up two flights of
stairs to the attic.</p>

<p>It was a low room with a shelving roof, and lighted
by a skylight, of which two or three of the panes were
broken, and a few stray snowflakes were floating in,
and hardly melting in the chilly air. There was an
old rusty stove instead of a fireplace, but no fire in
it; and in one corner lay a hard mattress, on which
they could see in the dim light the figure of a man,
barely covered with a few clothes. As he lifted up
his head to speak to them a racking cough choked
him, and it was a minute or two before he could utter
a word.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8216;We&#8217;ve been your neighbours a long while,&#8217; said
Ann, gently, &#8216;and I&#8217;m ashamed I never came to see
you before. We&#8217;ve brought little Bell home, for it&#8217;s
a dreadful night out of doors, not fit for a grown-up
person, scarcely.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But the landlord says he&#8217;ll turn us out to-morrow,&#8217;
gasped the sick man.</p>

<p>&#8216;No! no!&#8217; answered Ann; &#8216;that&#8217;s all right.
We&#8217;ve got the money ready for him, and now we&#8217;ll
make you as comfortable as we can. Sam run down
and bring me a light, that&#8217;s a good fellow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not going to live long,&#8217; said the stranger, &#8216;and
I&#8217;m afraid of being turned out, but I can never pay
you back again. There&#8217;s no more work in me, and
my money&#8217;s done; I can&#8217;t pay you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind,&#8217; she answered, &#8216;we&#8217;re only doing as
we&#8217;d be done by, so don&#8217;t you worry about it. Here&#8217;s
Sam coming with a candle; and now I&#8217;ll put your
bed straight.&#8217;</p>

<p>But when the light was brought in, and Ann
looked down at the poor covering on the mattress,
she uttered a little scream of amazement, and sank
down on a box beside the bed of the sick man. Sam
himself stood as still as a stone, staring, as she did,
at the clothes which lay across the bed. There was
his old wedding waistcoat; he knew it by a patch
which Ann had put into it very carefully. Was it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
possible that the nine five-pound notes were still safely
hidden in the lining?</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s an old waistcoat of mine,&#8217; he said, as soon
as he could speak; &#8216;I never thought to see it again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I bought it soon after I came here,&#8217; answered the
attic tenant; &#8216;an old-clothesman offered it for a
shilling. It&#8217;s been a good warm waistcoat; but I&#8217;ve
worn it for the last time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll give you a couple of blankets for it,&#8217; said Sam,
eagerly. &#8216;My wife sold it without asking me, and it
was my wedding waistcoat, you see. I didn&#8217;t want to
part with it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Take it, and welcome, without any blankets,&#8217; he
answered; &#8216;you&#8217;ve done enough for me already.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said Ann, &#8216;I&#8217;ll bring the blankets.&#8217;</p>

<p>She was trembling with excitement, but she would
not leave the poor man until she had stopped up the
broken panes, made the bed comfortable, and wrapped
him well up in some warm blankets. Then she went
down to their own room, and found Sam waiting for
her before opening the seam in the lining of the
waistcoat. Even his hand shook, but he managed to
unpick a few stitches, and draw out a crumpled bit of
paper. Yes; they were all there, the nine five-pound
notes he had never expected to touch again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Sam!&#8217; she cried, with tears in her eyes, &#8216;do
you think you will love them again?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>For a few minutes he sat still, looking earnestly at
the notes, with a strange expression of fear upon his
face. He compared the peace and happiness of the
last few months with the heavy burden his secret had
been to him. He thought of how he had begun to
learn to think of God when he awoke in the morning,
and when he was falling asleep at night. If he kept
the money, would it be the same? Yet would it be
right to throw away what God might intend them to
keep as a provision against some time of need? Perhaps
God saw the time was come when he might be
trusted with money again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ann,&#8217; he said, &#8216;If I thought these notes would
tempt me to serve mammon again, I&#8217;d throw them all
on to the fire yonder. You take charge of them, my
lass, and put them into the Post-Office Savings-bank,
that was opened a few months ago. Thank God I
lost them, and thank God I&#8217;ve found them again.&#8217;</p>

<p>For the next few weeks Sam Franklin and his
wife nursed and tended the dying man in the attic as
tenderly as if he had been their brother, teaching him
what Sam had learned himself, that even on a sick
bed he might work the works of God, by believing on
Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. When he died,
blessing them for their brotherly love to him, they
took charge of little Bell, and no doubt spent as much
upon her as the money laid by in the savings-bank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
But she grew up like a daughter to them; and not
long ago she became their daughter by marrying
Johnny Franklin. The wedding took place a day or
two before Christmas, the anniversary of the day
when Johnny readily gave up his small fortune for
little Bell.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Sam!&#8217; said his wife, as she thought of it,
&#8216;how would it have been if we&#8217;d kept the nine shillings
to buy clothes for Johnny?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We should have kept the nine shillings and lost
the forty-five pounds,&#8217; answered Sam. &#8216;It&#8217;s true, &#8220;He
that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord;
and that which he hath given will he pay him
again.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, but it&#8217;s more than that,&#8217; said Ann; &#8216;we&#8217;d a
chance of doing something like Jesus Christ would
have done in our place, and we did it. That was the
best of all.&#8217;</p>

A HAPPY NEW YEAR.</h2>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image029.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF you had asked any of the poor people of Ilverton
who was the prettiest and best girl in the town,
they would, one and all, have answered promptly, &#8216;Dr.
Layard&#8217;s daughter.&#8217; There was scarcely a poor man
or woman, who did not know the way to Dr. Layard&#8217;s
surgery, where he gave advice gratis to all who could
not really afford to pay for it. And there was scarcely
one who did not know the look of Dr. Layard&#8217;s bright,
comfortable, old-fashioned kitchen, and the pleasant,
tender smile on Kate Layard&#8217;s face, as she listened
pityingly to their sad stories, and sent them away
home with happier hearts and lighter spirits.</p>

<p>If it had not been for her poor people, as she
called them, Kate Layard&#8217;s life would have been
utterly dull and idle. She had no household duties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
to see after; her aunt, who had taken the management
of all such matters whilst she was still a little
girl, would not brook any interference with her rule;
and preferred to have Kate sitting in the drawing-room,
idly busy over fancy work, or practising music
to which no one listened, and painting water-colour
sketches, at which no one looked. There were three
boys younger than herself, but they were all away,
either at school or college; and the long days passed
by listlessly, for want of something to do that was really
worth the doing. But for her father&#8217;s poor patients,
and he had a good many of them, she would have felt
her life to be quite lost.</p>

<p>It was on a dull, dark day, near the end of November,
with a thick yellow fog pressing close against the
windows, which prevented her from going out, that
she felt particularly disconsolate and weary. Aunt
Brooks was busy about the house, making arrangements
for a thorough cleaning down before Christmas;
but she steadily refused Kate&#8217;s offers of help. Secretly
Aunt Brooks was fearful of Dr. Layard finding
out that Kate would make quite as good a housekeeper
as herself; and she shrank from the idea of
going into some little lonely house of her own, where
she could have no more than one little maid to order
about, and no scope at all for her own powers. She
did not think of Kate having no scope for hers. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
she had, it is quite possible that she would have laid
down her command, and heroically withdrawn to leave
Kate her proper post.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish, something would happen to me!&#8217; sighed
Kate, on that dull November morning. At the very
moment a servant brought in a letter, just delivered
by the postman. Kate was not quite sure of the
handwriting; not quite sure. But all at once a
vision of her father&#8217;s surgery flashed across her mind,
with a frank, noble, pleasant-looking young man in
her father&#8217;s place, giving advice and prescription, and
good-tempered, cheery words to her poor people. It
was Philip Carey, her father&#8217;s assistant, who had left
them some months ago. It seemed to Kate that she
had never been dull while he was there. Yes! the
letter was from Philip Carey; it bore his name. A
bright colour flushed up in Kate&#8217;s face. If there had
been any one in the room, she would have carried it
away to read it in solitude, although she did not yet
know a single word in it. But she was quite alone,
and no one could see the colour in her cheeks, or the
ready tears that sprang into her eyes, and made the
lines look dim.</p>

<p>&#8216;I used to fancy sometimes,&#8217; said Philip Carey,
&#8216;that I might win your love; but I never dared to be
sure of it. I was too poor then, and my future was
too uncertain, for me to say how dearly I loved you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
But now I am appointed the assistant physician at
Lentford Hospital, I think your father would be
satisfied with my prospects. I do not write to him
but to you. If there is any hope for me, if you can
trust your whole happiness to me, write but the one
word &#8220;Come,&#8221; and I will come over immediately after
my official appointment on the 30th, and speak to Dr.
Layard. If you do not write, I shall understand
your silence.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kate sat, with the letter crushed between her hands,
gazing blissfully into the fire. All the world was
changed, quite suddenly. The day was no longer dull
and dreary. It seemed almost too good to be true.
Philip Carey was the very man to be a physician in the
Lentford Hospital; he was so gentle and considerate
with the poor, and so skilful as well. She recollected
how all her poor people had bewailed and mourned
after him when he went away; and what a pang it
had often been to her, a pang yet a pleasure, to hear
his name so often on their lips. Oh! how good she
must be to make herself good enough for him! She
must be the best doctor&#8217;s wife in all Lentford.</p>

<p>With very unsteady fingers she wrote the one word
&#8216;Come&#8217; as Philip had suggested; and then it occurred
to her that she might catch the morning post, and he
would receive her answer before night. She directed
the envelope in haste, and ran out herself with it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
across the square; dropping it into the letter-box
with her own hands, and looking after it, as one does
sometimes when the letter is a very important one.</p>

<p>Kate kept her precious secret to herself. Aunt
Brooks was in a rather testy temper, and it was not
easy to begin such a confidential disclosure to her. Dr.
Layard was out all day, and only came in late at night,
worn out and exhausted. Kate rather rejoiced in the
secret being a secret. Everybody would know quite
soon enough; for her letter had reached her on the
28th, and Philip was sure to come over on the 30th, for
Lentford was only ten miles away, and he could ride
to Ilverton as soon as his official appointment was
confirmed.</p>

<p>Yet it seemed a long time before the 30th came.
Towards the close of the day Kate grew more
agitated in her secret gladness. Philip might come in
at any hour; he knew they dined at six, and Kate
was fully prepared to see him arrive then. But he
did not appear; and the dinner passed very nearly in
silence, for Kate was unable to talk, and Dr. Layard
was tired with his day&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you know, Kate,&#8217; he said suddenly, &#8216;young
Carey is appointed assistant physician at Lentford
Hospital? It&#8217;s a splendid opening for so young a man.
But he&#8217;s a fine fellow is Carey; I shall be more than
content if one of my boys turns out like him. Ah!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Katie, Katie, you should have set your cap at him
when he was here; you&#8217;ll never have such a chance
again.&#8217;</p>

<p>The colour mounted to her forehead, and a smile
played about her lips, ready to break into a happy
laugh. If Philip would but come in now!</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t put such notions into Kate&#8217;s head,&#8217; said
Aunt Brooks, precisely; &#8216;no well behaved young lady
would think of setting her cap at any one.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was a restless evening for Kate. One hour
after another passed by, and still he did not come.
She went to the window, and opened it impatiently.
She began to wonder if he meant to come in by
the last train, and stay all night. But what would
Aunt Brooks say? And what a strange hour
it would be to begin to talk to her father about
such a subject! She fancied it would take a very
long time to introduce it, and afterwards to discuss
it. But at half-past eleven Kate was compelled
to give up expecting him and go to bed, when the
fever of her new happiness having calmed a little,
she slept profoundly, and dreamed of no trouble.</p>

<p>But again there followed a morning and evening
of expectation, dogged hour after hour by a strengthening
disappointment. Kate sat moping over the fire, as
Aunt Brooks said, trying to find reasons for Philip&#8217;s
absence and silence. The crumpled letter had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
carefully smoothed out again, and she read it till she
knew every word by heart. But the pride and gladness
died as her heart grew sick with the sickness of hope
deferred. The brief sunshine at last faded quite out
of her life, and left her in deeper darkness than before.
She waited and trusted till she could wait and trust
no longer; and then she gave herself up to the full
sense of her bitter mortification and sorrow.</p>

<p>There was no one to notice the change except
her father, who was too busy to bestow more than
a passing thought or two to her melancholy face and
fading colour. Her happiness, like Jonah&#8217;s gourd,
had sprung up in a night and perished in a night; and
like him she was ready to exclaim, &#8216;It is better for me
to die than to live.&#8217;</p>

<p>Christmas was near at hand before Kate recovered
at all from her overwhelming sense of wretchedness
and mortification. She was a pitiful and tender-hearted
girl, fond of giving pleasure to others; and
she began to feel as if it was necessary for her own
relief to make this miserable Christmas a time of
pleasure and festivity to some of her poorer neighbours.
If she could not see happiness with her own
eyes, she would like to look at it through other
people&#8217;s. It was impossible to remove the heaviness
of her heart, but she might try to lighten others&#8217;. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
one evening when she and her father were alone together,
she approached the subject cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8216;Father,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I want to make somebody in
the world happier.&#8217;</p>

<p>Her voice was unconsciously very sorrowful.
The burden that was oppressing her had made her
feel that other people had heavy burdens to bear.
She was learning that, in order to bear her own well,
it was necessary to share that of another. Dr. Layard
was distressed by the mournfulness of his daughter&#8217;s
tone.</p>

<p>&#8216;Make somebody happier!&#8217; he repeated; &#8216;well, it
is easy enough to do that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How?&#8217; asked Kate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Help them,&#8217; answered Dr. Layard; &#8216;a little
help is worth a deal of pity. Helping people is
a good step towards making them and yourself
happy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That is what I want to do,&#8217; said Kate, eagerly.
&#8216;I want you to manage so that I can have some of
your poor patients to tea here, in the large kitchen,
on Christmas Day; it would make them a little bit
happier, I think. I don&#8217;t know that it would do
much good, but they would enjoy it, wouldn&#8217;t they,
father?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It would do them good, Kate,&#8217; said Dr. Layard;
&#8216;making people happy sometimes goes before making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
them good. In the hospital at times we make
our patients as happy as they can be before the
sharp operation; sometimes the sharp operation has
to come first. We&#8217;ll try the merry Christmas for
them this year, and then you must do what you can
for them afterwards.&#8217;</p>

<p>Aunt Brooks, somewhat unexpectedly, gave a very
gracious assent to Dr. Layard&#8217;s proposal, on condition
that Kate took all the trouble of preparing for the
guests, and entertaining them when they came. It
made her busy enough for two or three days, and she
tried to throw all her sad heart into it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Kate,&#8217; said Dr. Layard, on Christmas Eve, &#8216;we
have forgotten one of our old favourites, who has
not been here for months. You recollect old Mrs.
Duffy, who used to go about with a basket of bobbins
and tapes? Of all my poor patients, she ought to be
present at your <i>soir&eacute;e</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>Dr. Layard persisted in calling the intended tea-party
Kate&#8217;s <i>soir&eacute;e</i>, and had taken an unusual interest
in it. She was feeling more sorrowful than ever, this
Christmas Eve, when everybody seemed so absurdly
gay. She was wearing her dowdiest dress; and she
found it difficult to get up a smile when her father
spoke of the <i>soir&eacute;e</i>. How different it would have been
if Philip Carey had been true to her!</p>

<p>&#8216;Can I find Mrs. Duffy this evening?&#8217; she asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
willing to escape from her sad thoughts for a little
time.</p>

<p>&#8216;Easily,&#8217; said Dr. Layard; &#8216;she lives in Wright&#8217;s
Court, out of New Street, the last house but two on
your left hand, I think. Anybody would tell you
where it is. If you are frightened, take Bob with you.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was a dark night when Kate started out, without
Bob, for she was not frightened; she was too miserable
to be frightened. The passing relief she had
felt in making her arrangements for her Christmas
tea-party was spent, and the universal merriment only
served to deepen her own loneliness and disappointment.
The streets were full and noisy, but not disorderly.
The church bells were ringing in anticipation
of the coming day, and a general holiday tone was
diffused through the crowd, though business was going
on briskly. Groups of little children were gathering
round the brilliant shop-windows, choosing impossible
Christmas presents for themselves and each other from
the magnificent display within, and laughing with
pathetic mirth at their own daring dreams. Kate
caught herself wondering if she should ever laugh at
her own vanished dream.</p>

<p>Wright&#8217;s Court was not a good specimen of street
architecture and paving. The houses were as low as
they could be to boast of two stories, and the pavement
was eccentric, making it necessary to take each
step with great caution. An open gutter ran down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the middle, and through the passage which formed the
entrance; a passage four feet wide and twenty feet
long, dimly lighted by one lamp in the street, which
shone behind Kate as she walked up it, and threw her
shadow bewilderingly before her. The court itself had
no light but that which came through the uncurtained
windows of the dwellings on each side, through which
she caught glimpses of startling phases of English life,
before she reached Mrs. Duffy&#8217;s door, where she stood
a minute or two in the dark, looking through the small
panes of the casement close beside it.</p>

<p>It was a very little kitchen, but quite large enough
for the furniture it contained. There was an old box
under the window, and one shelf against the wall,
holding all Mrs. Duffy&#8217;s china and plate. The only
chair, and a tiny table standing on three thick legs,
were drawn up to the fireplace, in which a few coals
were burning. Two old tin candlesticks and a flat-iron
adorned the chimneypiece, and Kate saw, with
a slight prick of her conscience, for she had not cared
to decorate the house at home, that a bit of holly had
been stuck into each candlestick, as well as into every
other pane of the little window. Mrs. Duffy herself
was seated in the chair, apparently amusing herself
with a pantomime of taking tea, for there was
a black teapot and a cracked cup and saucer on the
table, but there was no food upon it, and when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
held the teapot almost perpendicularly only a few
drops fell from the spout. She put it down, and
looked placidly into the embers, shaking her head a
little from time to time, but gently, as if more in remembrance
of the past than in reproach of the present.
She was a clean, fresh-looking old woman, with no
teeth, and her cheeks formed a little ball, like a withered
rosy apple, between her hollow eyes and sunken
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Lord love you, my dear,&#8217; said Mrs. Duffy,
when Kate went in, and delivered her message, &#8216;and
the good doctor, too. It isn&#8217;t everybody as has such
friends as me&mdash;on a Christmas Eve, too, when a body
feels so lonesome wi&#8217;out friends. I don&#8217;t mind so
much on working days, my dear, but one wants friends
of a holiday like-Christmas. One can work wi&#8217;out
friends; but one can&#8217;t love wi&#8217;out friends.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, indeed!&#8217; said Kate, with a profound sigh.</p>

<p>&#8216;And I&#8217;ve got such good friends!&#8217; continued Mrs.
Duffy, triumphantly; &#8216;there&#8217;s one as gave me sixpence,
and another threepence, and another twopence, only
this morning. That came up to elevenpence; so I&#8217;ve
bought my Christmas joint, just like other folks, you
know. You&#8217;d maybe like to see my Christmas joint
like other folks, shouldn&#8217;t you, my dear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I should very much,&#8217; answered Kate.</p>

<p>The Christmas joint was evidently a very precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
possession, for it had been laid carefully between a
plate and a basin, and these were well tied up in a
ragged cloth, and put out of the way of any marauding
cat. Kate&#8217;s eyebrows went up a good deal, and her
eyelids smarted a little as if with coming tears, when
she saw it. It was a morsel of coarse beef, which would
not have covered the old woman&#8217;s hand, but which she
regarded with unconcealed satisfaction and delight.</p>

<p>&#8216;That cost sevenpence,&#8217; she said, &#8216;and I bought two
pennyworth of greens, and a twopenny loaf to eat with
it&mdash;me and a friend of mine, as is coming to dine with
me. It&#8217;s a very poor lame girl as lives down the court;
very poor, indeed, so I asked her to come and help to
eat my Christmas joint, which is exceedingly pleasant
to me. The neighbour next door has promised to
lend me a chair; we&#8217;re all so friendly one with another.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then if you have a visitor you must bring her
with you to tea,&#8217; said Kate, &#8216;and any children you
have. Haven&#8217;t you got any sons or daughters?
You&#8217;d enjoy yourself more with them there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless your kind heart all the same,&#8217; answered
Mrs. Duffy, her cheerful face overcast for a moment;
&#8216;I never had more than one bonny boy, and he went
off to Australy nigh upon thirty years ago. My
Johnny he was. Sometimes I think as I shall never
see him again. I was thinking of him when your
knock came to the door. He was going on for twenty;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and I was a strong woman of forty then. I doubt
whether Johnny &#8217;ud know his poor old mother again if
he did come back.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How long is it since you heard from him?&#8217;
enquired Kate.</p>

<p>&#8216;I never heard from him at all,&#8217; said Mrs. Duffy,
in a matter-of-course tone; &#8216;he couldn&#8217;t write, and I
couldn&#8217;t write. But he went to Australy, and he is in
Australy now, if he hasn&#8217;t tumbled off. I can&#8217;t help
thinking at times he must ha&#8217; tumbled off, though the
flies never do tumble off the ceiling. I&#8217;ve watched
&#8217;em for hours and hours together, thinking of my
Johnny, and no fly never tumbled off yet. They have
to walk with their heads downwards in Australy, like
them flies; but my Johnny wasn&#8217;t brought up to it,
and I&#8217;m afeard for him at times.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, no, he couldn&#8217;t tumble off,&#8217; said Kate, laughing
a little; &#8216;but are you sure you would know him yourself,
Mrs. Duffy, after thirty years?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can a mother forget her own boy?&#8217; asked the
old woman; &#8216;ay, ay; I should know my Johnny
among a thousand, or tens of thousands. I&#8217;ll be glad
to bring my friend with me to-morrow, and many
thanks to you for asking her. I&#8217;ve got to go out into the
country to sing a carril or two at a farm-house, where
they&#8217;re always very good to me; but that&#8217;ll be afore
dinner; and we&#8217;ll come punctual to your house at five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
o&#8217;clock, me and my friend; and a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year to every one of us, and you
above all, my dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A miserable Christmas, and an unhappy New
Year it will be for me,&#8217; thought Kate; but she did
not say it. Mrs. Duffy insisted upon lighting her
down the court with her only candle, which guttered
and wasted terribly in the night wind; and the last
glance she had of the kindly, withered old face was
lit up by its flickering flame at the entrance of the
dark passage.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning, long before the Christmas
sun was ready to show itself, Mrs. Duffy roused
up to the fact that if she was to sing a &#8216;carril&#8217; a mile
and a half away in the country, it was time to set out.
Even her hard heap of rags and straw, with the thin,
scanty blanket she had been shivering under all night,
were more attractive to her at seventy years of age
than the long, lonely walk, through lanes deep down
between high hedgerows, with cartruts filled with
mingled mud and ice. But she was of a brave and
grateful heart, and after a short prayer for herself and
everybody, uttered before quitting the feeble warmth
of her bed, she sallied out into the chill frostiness of
the coming dawn. Up and down the street she heard
the shrill voices of children chanting some Christmas
ditty; and she thought of Johnny when he was a boy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
with his yellow hair, and round, red face, turning out
all eagerness and hope on a Christmas morning, and
singing in a voice which could not fail to rouse the
most determined sleeper.</p>

<p>&#8216;He came home once with three shillings and twopence
halfpenny, all in ha&#8217;pence,&#8217; thought Mrs. Duffy,
wiping away a tear from the sunken corner of her eye.</p>

<p>It was a wearisome walk to the farm-house; but
as soon as she had reached the porch, and lifting up
her quavering voice, began, &#8216;God rest you, merry
gentlefolk, Let nothing you dismay,&#8217; the door was
flung open quickly, and she was called in, and set before
such a breakfast as she had not seen for years.
Poor old Mrs. Duffy&#8217;s heart was very full, and before
she could swallow a morsel, she said in a slow and
tremulous voice: &#8216;I can&#8217;t think what&#8217;s come to folks
this year. It&#8217;s like them blessed Christmases we shall
have when everybody&#8217;s friends, when the lion is friends
with the lamb, and the cockatrices with the babies.
Here&#8217;s Dr. Layard&#8217;s daughter asked me to tea, and
I&#8217;ve got a Christmas joint, and now there&#8217;s such a
breakfast as I never see before, and me done nothing
for it. I can&#8217;t think what&#8217;s come to folks; but it&#8217;s a
blessed Christmas, it is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll sing your carol for us better after breakfast,&#8217;
said the farmer&#8217;s wife, &#8216;and my husband&#8217;s father
has given me a shilling for you.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Mrs. Duffy shed a few very blissful tears, and after
breakfast sang two or three carols, with as much zeal
and energy as though they were sure to bring down
many blessings on the hospitable roof. It was a little
after nine o&#8217;clock when she left the house; but there
was the Christmas dinner to cook, and it was necessary
to go home early for that. She bade them good-by,
and took her way joyously across the fields lying in
winter-fallow, through which there was a nearer way
back to the town.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duffy was just turning out of the fields into
the high road, when a man suddenly started up from
behind the hedge, and laid his hand roughly on her
shoulder. He was a big, heavy-looking fellow, in the
ordinary dress of a labourer; and he seemed, even at
that early hour, to be half stupefied with drink. She
looked into his coarse face, with a feeling of terror
which was new to her.</p>

<p>&#8216;I want a shilling off you,&#8217; he said, fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8216;A shilling!&#8217; she cried, &#8216;where should a poor
woman like me have a shilling from?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Haven&#8217;t you got a shilling?&#8217; he demanded.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Duffy had prided herself all her life on
never having told a lie. She looked up and down the
road, but there was not a creature in sight; and she
glanced again hopelessly into the man&#8217;s savage and
stupid face. What should she do? To part with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the shilling just given to her would be a very great
loss; and she knew it would only be spent in the
nearest public-house. Should she be doing very
wrong to deny having one? It was the first time for
years that she had had a whole silver shilling about
her; and any moment during that time she could have
replied &#8216;No&#8217; boldly and truthfully. Might she not say
&#8216;No&#8217; just this once?</p>

<p>&#8216;Haven&#8217;t you got a shilling?&#8217; he repeated, shaking
her shoulder roughly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; she said, feebly, &#8216;I haven&#8217;t had a shilling
ever so long; but I have got one now. I&#8217;m a very
poor old woman, my good young man. If I&#8217;d got a
penny, I&#8217;d give it you, and welcome.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I must have your shilling,&#8217; he said, doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t give it you, indeed,&#8217; she answered; &#8216;there&#8217;s
my rent, and coals, and other things; and I&#8217;m very
poor. You&#8217;d only drink it.&#8217;</p>

<p>She had scarcely finished speaking, when she saw
the stranger produce a pistol from under his jacket,
and point it at her. There was a sudden flash before
her eyes, and she felt a keen pain; then she fell down
without feeling or consciousness under the hedge-bank
on the high road. A few minutes later, Dr. Layard&#8217;s
brougham was stopping at a toll-gate just outside the
town, when a labouring man, who was striding swiftly
past, spoke a few words to the driver. Dr. Layard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
was inside, with Kate, who was going out with him to
see her godfather, a clergyman in the next parish.
The doctor, having finished what he had to say to
the gatekeeper, inquired what the labourer had said
in passing.</p>

<p>&#8216;He says there&#8217;s a woman up the road, who&#8217;s been
shot, sir,&#8217; answered the servant, &#8216;and he says to me,
&#8220;Look sharp after her, she&#8217;s an old woman, and very
poor.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shot!&#8217; exclaimed Dr. Layard; &#8216;drive on then,
quickly. Katie, don&#8217;t be frightened. Gate, look after
that fellow who has just gone through.&#8217;</p>

<p>The last order was shouted through the window,
as the carriage rolled rapidly away. In a few minutes
they gained the spot where the old woman was lying
as one dead, under the leafless hedge, with the blood
staining the thin shawl which was wrapped about her.
Her old wrinkled face had lost all its apple-red, and
her grey hair, scanty and short, had fallen down from
under her white cap. Both Dr. Layard and Katie
exclaimed in one breath, &#8216;Mrs. Duffy!&#8217;</p>

<p>Kate was not wanting in nerve, though she felt a
little shaken, and exceedingly troubled. She left the
carriage, and sat down on the bank, supporting Mrs.
Duffy in her arms, while Dr. Layard made a brief
examination of the wounds in the poor old neck and
shoulder. His expression was very grave, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
stood for a few moments deliberating silently, with his
eyes fastened upon the deathlike face of Mrs. Duffy,
and the pretty, anxious face of his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it dangerous?&#8217; asked Kate, falteringly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Almost fatal,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;within a touch of
death. There&#8217;s one chance. I&#8217;m thinking of driving
straight to Lentford Hospital. It&#8217;s a good level road
all the way, and the hospital is at this end of the
town. If you get into the brougham first, I can lift
the old woman, and place her in an easy posture
against you. Could you hold her pretty much as you
are now for an hour or more? I&#8217;d do it myself; but
you could not lift her in as I shall do. Are you strong
enough?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will be strong enough; I will do it,&#8217; said Kate,
lifting up her head with determination and endurance
in every line of her face.</p>

<p>It did not occur to Dr. Layard that his carriage
was a new one, handsomely lined and fitted up; but
the servant&#8217;s soul ran more upon such subjects, and
he began to protest against lifting the wounded and
bleeding woman into it. Such a very miserable old
creature, too, thought Bob, not a bit of a lady.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dolt! idiot! brute!&#8217; ejaculated Dr. Layard, in
high wrath; and Bob, who had only uttered half his
protest, shut his mouth, and was silent.</p>

<p>It seemed a very long time to Kate, though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
carriage bowled rapidly along the smooth, straight old
Roman road. Poor Mrs. Duffy gave no sign of life,
but lay against her heavily, with her grey head resting
upon Kate&#8217;s shoulder. She held her as tenderly as
she could, now and then clasping her warm fingers
about her wrist, which was knotted and brown with
age and hard work, but which gave no throb back to
Kate&#8217;s touch. Dr. Layard, who rode outside with
Bob, looked round from time to time, nodding to her,
but with so grave a face that she felt the case was
very serious. She thanked God fervently when the
spires of Lentford came in sight, and the last notes of
the morning chimes fell upon her ear. There were
streams of people going to church, exchanging cheery
salutations with one another; but many a person
caught a glimpse of Kate&#8217;s pale and agitated face, and
the grey head lying against her neck, and felt a shadow
pass over their own Christmas gladness.</p>

<p>Dr. Layard&#8217;s carriage drove into the courtyard of
the hospital, and then Kate was quickly relieved of
her burden. Mrs. Duffy was carried away, and Dr.
Layard followed her. Kate sat there, anxious and
troubled, while the clock in the nearest church tower
struck one quarter after another, and Bob drove up
and down at a snail&#8217;s pace in dreary and monotonous
turns. At length some one beckoned to him from the
hospital portico, and Bob responded with an alacrity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
which betrayed his impatience. Kate only saw at the
last moment that it was Dr. Carey, not her father,
who had summoned him; and she shrank back,
breathless and tremulous, into the corner of the carriage
which concealed her best from him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bob, your master says you must drive home,&#8217; said
Dr. Carey; &#8216;he will return by train in the afternoon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And the old woman, sir?&#8217; said Bob, &#8216;how&#8217;s she
going on?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very little hope,&#8217; answered Philip Carey, whose
face Kate could not see, but whose voice made every
nerve thrill.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it murder?&#8217; asked Bob, who had known Dr.
Carey as his master&#8217;s assistant, and stood on very
little ceremony with him.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m afraid so,&#8217; he said; &#8216;how are they all at home,
Bob? Miss Brooks and Miss Kate?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s in there,&#8217; said Bob, pointing with his thumb
to the carriage. Kate roused herself to lift up her
head with dignity, sit erect upon her seat, and meet
Dr. Carey&#8217;s salutation calmly. It was nearly four weeks
since he had written to her, and she had replied,
&#8216;Come.&#8217; He looked at her with an amazed and confused
expression, and took off his hat, but did not
attempt to speak. Both of them coloured, and both
bowed stiffly and in silence. Then Philip Carey, still
bareheaded, and as if lost in thought, walked slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
back up the broad steps of the portico, and Kate cried
most of the way home.</p>

<p>&#8216;I never saw anything like that,&#8217; thought Bob;
&#8216;and they used to be like brother and sister, almost.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Dr. Layard returned,
and then he had to see the superintendent
of police. The stranger who had passed through the
toll-gate had not yet been found; but he could not be
far off, and Bob was ready to swear to him when he
was taken. Kate&#8217;s Christmas party passed off more
successfully because one of the invited guests had been
almost murdered on the highway. The news ran like
wildfire through the town and neighbourhood, and the
farmer&#8217;s wife came to tell of Mrs. Duffy&#8217;s morning
visit, and her cheerful carols just before the villain
met her. She and Kate mingled their tears together
over the recital, and Kate ended her miserable Christmas
by going to bed with a very heavy heart.</p>

<p>The next day the stranger was found and sworn
to by Bob, though he flatly denied having been anywhere
in the direction of the toll-bar. Neither Dr.
Layard nor the toll-man could swear to him, as he had
passed on the farther side of the carriage while they
were talking at the other window. He was an utter
stranger in the neighbourhood, without friends, and he
stated that he was on the tramp. A very old pistol
was found in a ditch near the spot where Mrs. Duffy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
had been shot. The man was sent in safe custody to
Lentford, to be brought face to face with the old
woman, if she should recover consciousness enough
to identify him and give her evidence against him.</p>

<p>For twenty-four hours or more it continued very
doubtful whether the poor old creature would ever
rally. She had not spoken since she had been found,
but she lay perfectly tranquil and patient on her
hospital bed. Now and then a gleam of a smile, like
the momentary glimmer of the sun on a cloudy day
crossed her face, and her lips moved slightly, as if she
were whispering. She knew when they were doing
anything for her, for she tried to help herself, to raise
her thin hand, or turn her grey head upon the pillow
for them to see her neck. Dr. Carey, who had
known her in former days, spent as much time as he
could beside her bed; and towards the close of the
day, just before the night nurse was coming to take
her turn, he heard her voice speaking articulately but
very slowly and faintly, and he stooped over her to
listen to what she said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dr. Layard&#8217;s daughter! Dr. Layard&#8217;s daughter!&#8217;
she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you like to see Dr. Layard&#8217;s daughter?&#8217;
asked Philip Carey, in his clearest and most pleasant
tone.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay,&#8217; whispered the old woman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8216;To-morrow you shall,&#8217; he said; &#8216;it is too late
now. To-morrow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay,&#8217; she assented, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will be better to-morrow,&#8217; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no,&#8217; murmured the old woman. &#8216;He shot
me dead because I wouldn&#8217;t give him my shilling.
He robbed me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s a shilling wrapped up in a bit of blue
sugar-paper in your pocket,&#8217; said Dr. Carey. A
sparkle of satisfaction shone upon the poor drawn
face, and then Mrs. Duffy fell quietly asleep.</p>

<p>She was certainly somewhat better in the morning,
and watching the people who were about her; her mind
was clear, and she evidently knew her circumstances,
where she was, and what had happened to her. Before
noon Dr. Layard and Kate arrived; and Mrs. Duffy&#8217;s
sunken blue eyes brightened, yet filled with tears, as
she looked up into their faces bending pityingly above
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, old friend,&#8217; said Dr. Layard, heartily, &#8216;you
are better already. We are going to pull you through,
you&#8217;ll see, Carey and me. We know what a tough
old lady you are. Carey used to play you some
tricks in the old times, and now he&#8217;ll make it up
to you by pulling you through. Won&#8217;t you, Carey?&#8217;</p>

<p>Kate had not seen him enter the ward, and now
she sat down, feeling weak and tremulous, on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
chair at Mrs. Duffy&#8217;s head, keeping her eyes fixed
upon the old woman&#8217;s face. Dr. Carey&#8217;s voice sounded
oddly in her ears, as if he was speaking in very loud
and constrained tones.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am going to do my best,&#8217; he said, &#8216;but you
must keep yourself quite still now, Mrs. Duffy, and
get up your strength to tell the magistrate your story.
You are a brave old woman, and won&#8217;t be afraid;
and I&#8217;ll tell them you never told a lie in your life.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Duffy smiled, but did not speak. She had
not spoken yet, but she stretched out her hand, and
tried to turn towards Kate. Dr. Carey seemed to
understand her meaning perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8216;You want Dr. Layard&#8217;s daughter to sit where you
can see her?&#8217; he said. &#8216;You want her to stay with
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay,&#8217; she answered. &#8216;God bless her!&#8217;</p>

<p>It was Philip Carey who moved Kate&#8217;s chair, and
placed it in a convenient position for old Mrs. Duffy
to see her. She glanced at him once, but his eyes
were downcast, and his aspect very solemn. He bade
one of the nurses bring her a footstool, and then he
and her father went away, and old Mrs. Duffy, smiling
now and then, closed her eyes and seemed to fall into
a doze.</p>

<p>It was a very quiet hour for Kate. The ward
was a small one, containing only four beds, and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
other patient in it. The nurses were busy, and had
all gone away, leaving her alone. A wintry sunshine
was falling through the farthest window upon
the bare white walls. Her mind was strangely divided
between Mrs. Duffy and Philip Carey, whose life
was spent mostly within these walls. He had spoken
so kindly, even affectionately, to this poor, friendless
old woman, but he had not spoken a word to her.
How was it that he could be so fickle, so cruel towards
her? What reason or motive could possibly have
made him change his mind so suddenly and so dishonourably,
and plunge her into so much wretchedness
and perplexity? She could not bear to meet
him, yet she would have to bear it, for her father was
so fond of him. How proud and happy her father
would have been in him as his son in-law! It was
too hard even to think of. Perhaps she would even
have the misery some day of seeing his wife, the girl
who had supplanted her, and made her life a blank.
For Kate felt sure that it would be impossible for her
ever to love another man. No one else could be to
her what Philip Carey had been.</p>

<p>The hour passed away, and there were several
quiet signs of excitement. Dr. Layard and Dr. Carey
came in, felt the old woman&#8217;s pulse, and gave her a
cordial. Kate was told that if she could be calm she
had better remain where she was, as Mrs. Duffy held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
her hand closely, and wished her to stay. Three or
four strange gentlemen came in, and stood about the
bed, while Mrs. Duffy, in very feeble tones, told her
story, which was written down, word for word, from
her lips. She had not much to say, and it was soon
over.</p>

<p>&#8216;Could you identify the individual?&#8217; inquired the
magistrate&#8217;s clerk.</p>

<p>&#8216;Should you know the man again?&#8217; asked Dr.
Carey, who was standing close to Kate, and near old
Mrs. Duffy.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, to be sure,&#8217; she answered, with more energy
than she had displayed before.</p>

<p>&#8216;He has been taken;&#8217; said Dr. Layard; &#8216;that is,
a man has been taken up, and we think he is the man.
You must see him yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>The old woman shuddered, and grasped Kate&#8217;s
hand tightly. It might have been Dr. Carey&#8217;s hand,
for he seemed conscious of the close grasp, and
answered to it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come, come,&#8217; he said, encouragingly, &#8216;you never
used to be a coward; and you have only to open your
eyes, and look at him. You have plenty of friends
about you, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a dreadful man,&#8217; she said, in a whisper, &#8216;but
let him come.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kate herself felt a strong thrill of excitement, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
she listened to the regular tramp of the policeman,
and the shambling tread of the murderer, coming
down the bare boards of the ward. The old woman had
closed her eyes, as if to gather strength for the dreadful
detective gaze. Dr. Carey laid his hand on the back
of Kate&#8217;s chair, so close to her it almost touched her
shoulder, and one of her brown curls fell upon it. The
footsteps came on to the side of the bed, and stopped
there. Kate turned her head and took one frightened
glance. The murderer was a middle-aged man,
with a full, heavy, red face, and light hair just turning
grey, not a vicious-looking man on the whole; he might
have been a decent, honest, creditable fellow, but for
the drinking habits which had brutalised him. He was
looking down at the wounded old woman with an air
half sorrowful and half ashamed; but a little sullen
also, as a boy looks when caught in some fault. The
policeman at his right hand was the only sign to
mark him out as a criminal; and he seemed as much
on the alert as if he expected him to make a second
murderous attack on the old woman in her bed. For
a minute or two all were silent in the room. Mrs.
Duffy&#8217;s eyelids were closed, and her lips moved as if
in prayer. She looked up at last; and her dim blue
eyes, which were full of terror, like those of a child
who wakes frightened, changed like those of a child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
when it sees that the face bending over it is a familiar
face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; she cried, in a voice at once firm and glad,
&#8216;it&#8217;s my boy! It&#8217;s my Johnny!&#8217;</p>

<p>Her wrinkled features began to work with emotion,
and she was about to raise herself up to stretch
out her arms to him, but Dr. Carey was quick enough
to prevent her. He threw himself on his knees at
Kate&#8217;s feet, and laid his strong arm gently across the
old woman. Every one else stood motionless and
thunderstruck. The man himself did not stir hand
or foot.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s my son as went to Australy,&#8217; continued
Mrs. Duffy; &#8216;please let him come and kiss me.
Don&#8217;t you know your poor old mother again, Johnny?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, mother! mother!&#8217; exclaimed the man,
striking his hard hands together, &#8216;that&#8217;s my mother
sir, as I came back to, and was looking for. I hadn&#8217;t
seen her these thirty years, and she&#8217;s nothing like the
woman she was. You&#8217;ll let me go and kiss her,
maybe?&#8217;</p>

<p>He had spoken to the policeman next to him,
and his official eye was softened; but the magistrates
were there, and the indulgence was not his to
grant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is this the person who attempted first to rob
and then to murder you?&#8217; asked the magistrate&#8217;s
clerk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>&#8216;Oh, dear no! it&#8217;s my boy,&#8217; said the old woman;
&#8216;he&#8217;d never shoot at his mother, bless you! It was
quite a different man, not him; a dreadful man.
That&#8217;s the boy I nursed, and taught him his prayers.
He&#8217;d never lift up his hand agen me; please let him
go.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was no question in Mrs. Duffy&#8217;s mind as
to whether she was telling the truth or not. Her
gladness was so great that her mind utterly refused
the incredible and impossible idea that her own son
could have thought of robbing and murdering her.
If he had been brought before her red-handed with
her blood, she would still have believed herself mistaken.
It was some ruffian and monster who had shot
her, not her son. As for him, his heavy, bloodshot
eyes were filled with tears, and his voice, as he began
to speak, was choked and husky.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; he said, addressing no one in particular,
&#8216;she&#8217;s not like the same woman, but she&#8217;s my mother.
She had brown hair, and was very strong. I never
thought of her being like that. I wish I&#8217;d kept free
from drink. Nobody knows what drink&#8217;ll bring him
to. She&#8217;s my mother; and I came back to work
for her, if she were still alive. I&#8217;ll never taste a drop
again as long&#8217;s I live.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush, hush!&#8217; said Dr. Layard, coming behind
him, and tapping him on the shoulder; &#8216;hold your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
tongue, my good fellow. You&#8217;ll make your mother
worse again if you talk. There&#8217;s a good chance for
her if she&#8217;s kept quiet.&#8217;</p>

<p>The magistrates and their clerk walked away to
the end of the ward, and held a short consultation
there. There was not much doubt that this man was
the right man; but there was no one to bring home
the crime to him, except his mother. Bob, Dr. Layard&#8217;s
servant, swore positively that he was the man
who told him a woman was lying in the road murdered;
but the woman herself denied that it was he
who had attacked her. To be sure there was more
than sufficient reason for her to do so, but if she persisted
in it, what was to be done?</p>

<p>&#8216;You must remember you are upon your oath,&#8217;
said the elder magistrate, &#8216;and probably upon your
deathbed. Now look at this man carefully, and tell
me if he is not the man who shot at you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Duffy gazed earnestly at her son, smiling
more and more, until her pale, shrunken face grew
radiant with happiness.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, it couldn&#8217;t be him,&#8217; she said, &#8216;how could it?
Ay, ay; I could swear it were never him; my Johnny.
Please let him stay aside of me for a bit. The police
may stop for him if you like; but he&#8217;d never do it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Carey and I will be bail for him, if it&#8217;s necessary,&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
said Dr. Layard, &#8216;only let the poor fellow shake
hands with his mother. There, let him go.&#8217;</p>

<p>The man seemed to slip suddenly from the policeman&#8217;s
grasp, and sunk down on his knees at his
mother&#8217;s feet, hiding his face in the bed-clothes, and
sobbing till the bed shook under him. All the time
his mother&#8217;s eyes were shining upon him, and her
arms, still kept firmly down by Dr. Carey, were
trembling to touch him.</p>

<p>The magistrates and their retinue went their way,
leaving Mrs. Duffy with her son, while Kate and
Philip Carey stood by, a little aloof from them, and
from each other. The man crept closer and closer
to his mother, till his hot and heavy face rested upon
her hand. There was a deep silence in the ward.
Outside in the corridor, through the half open door,
could be seen the policeman, still waiting for final
orders.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mother,&#8217; sobbed out Duffy, in a smothered and
faltering voice, &#8216;can you forgive me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why! there&#8217;s nothing to forgive, Johnny,&#8217; she
said, &#8216;and I&#8217;m so happy, I&#8217;d forgive everybody. I&#8217;d
forgive the raskill as shot me. I have forgive him
already, Johnny.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I want you to get well, mother,&#8217; he said, with
desperate earnestness, &#8216;and I&#8217;ll make it all up to you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
I&#8217;m come back to work for you, and indeed, I&#8217;ll work.
Will you forgive me, mother?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Forgive you, Johnny!&#8217; she murmured, &#8216;it&#8217;s a
easy thing to forgive a body when you love a body.&#8217;</p>

<p>The last words dropped faintly, syllable by syllable,
from the old woman&#8217;s white lips, and Kate&#8217;s heart
sank like lead. The withered face had grown paler,
and the wrinkled eyelids closed slowly over the filmy
blue eyes. Kate uttered a low cry of trouble, and
Philip Carey turned quickly towards her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is she going to die, Philip?&#8217; asked Kate.</p>

<p>&#8216;She is very faint,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;She has been too
much excited, but she may rally yet. Go and send
me a nurse, and do not return yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kate walked softly down the ward, the tears
falling fast from her eyes. She was no longer grieving
over her own troubles, but for the hopeful, cheery,
brave old woman, who had met her long-lost son
again in such a manner, and at such a moment as
this. She waited in the matron&#8217;s parlour until a
message was brought to her that Mrs. Duffy was
sleeping again, with her son watching and waiting
beside her. Then she returned home with her father.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve not the shadow of a doubt Duffy&#8217;s the man,&#8217;
shouted Dr. Layard to her, above the noise of the
train; &#8216;but the thing cannot be brought home to him.
The old woman is as true as truth itself, but she is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
labouring under a delusion. She no more believes
that her son was the man who shot at her than I believe
that you did it. I question whether she would
believe Duffy himself if he owned it to her, which he
must not do. I&#8217;ve told him so. I said, &#8220;Duffy, I feel
pretty sure you are the villain that did it, and if she
dies I&#8217;ll do my best to prove it. But never you tell
your mother it was yourself; it would go far to break
her heart.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never speak a word
about it, one way or the other, sir.&#8221; Oh! Duffy did it!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you think she will die?&#8217; asked Kate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Carey will do his best for her,&#8217; said Dr. Layard;
&#8216;I never saw such a change in a young fellow as there
is in Carey. He is as dull as a beetle; just when he
has got all he has been striving for, too! I don&#8217;t understand
it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kate believed she understood it, but she kept
silence. It was not likely he could feel happy and
at ease in her presence or her father&#8217;s if he had a
spark of feeling; and he certainly possessed a good
deal of feeling. She had caught his eye once during
the strange interview round Mrs. Duffy&#8217;s bed, and
they had looked at one another with a sympathy
which had seemed at the moment the most natural
thing in the world. She had called him Philip, too!
How her cheeks burned at the very recollection. She
wished she had preserved to the end an icy dignity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
manner towards him; but she had altogether forgotten
herself, and it had been a happier moment than
she had felt for these four weeks past. Perhaps utter
forgetfulness of self is the only real happiness.</p>

<p>The next morning Kate was once more sitting
alone before the fire in the breakfast-room, with nothing
particular to do, until it was time to start for
Lentford once more, when the servant brought in a
large official-looking cover, with the words &#8216;Dead
Letter Office&#8217; printed upon it, and addressed &#8216;Miss
Kate Layard, Ilverton.&#8217; It was the first time in her
life that Kate had ever received such an ominous-looking
packet. She opened it with some trepidation,
and drew from it her own brief note to Philip Carey,
written four weeks before. The envelope bore several
postmarks upon it, with directions to try one town
after another&mdash;Liverpool, then Manchester, then London&mdash;but
it was several minutes before she discovered
how it had all happened. Her own handwriting lay
before her eyes, or she could never have believed it:
she had directed her letter to &#8216;Dr. Carey, Everton
Square, Liverpool.&#8217;</p>

<p>How Kate had come to write Liverpool instead
of Lentford she could never understand. It was
true Philip had gone to Liverpool after leaving
Ilverton, but how stupid of her to make such a dreadful
mistake! Then he, too, had been passing through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
as miserable a time as herself. He must have come
to the conclusion that she did not care for him, and
that she had not even the grace to thank him for the
love he had bestowed upon her in vain. What could
he have thought of her? It must have been a pain
to him. She would make it up to him in some
way.</p>

<p>Kate&#8217;s brain was in a whirl all the way to
Lentford. She walked up the broad steps of the
hospital portico like one in a dream. The fat
porter, in his handsome livery, nodded pleasantly
at her; and the students, hurrying along the broad
corridors, took off their hats to Dr. Layard&#8217;s pretty
daughter. She had to pass by a recess as large as
a good-sized room, with benches round and across
it, upon which were seated rows of poor patients,
waiting humbly for their turn to go in and see the
doctor. The doorkeeper had just opened the door an
inch or two, and Kate saw Philip Carey&#8217;s face, grave
and care-worn, listening to a poor woman who was
just going away by another entrance. She laid her
hand upon the arm of the patient who was going in,
and passed on into the room instead. &#8216;Philip,&#8217; she
said, her face flushing at his look of amazement, &#8216;I
am only going to stay one moment. I have been so
miserable. I wrote this four weeks ago.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Wrote what?&#8217; he asked, clasping the hand with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
which she offered him the misdirected letter, and
holding both closely.</p>

<p>&#8216;I only wrote &#8220;Come,&#8221;&#8217; stammered Kate, the
tears starting into her eyes, &#8216;and I thought&mdash;oh, I
don&#8217;t know what I thought! I directed it to Liverpool
instead of Lentford, and it&#8217;s been wandering
about ever since. Do you understand?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you mean you will be my wife?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; she answered.</p>

<p>They had only three minutes to themselves.
Three minutes was the time allotted for each case,
and as it expired the door was opened again an inch
or two to see if the doctor was ready for the next
patient. Dr. Carey led Kate to the other door, and
dismissed her with a glance which set her heart
beating fast with happiness. She mounted the long
flight of stairs and entered the ward where Mrs.
Duffy was lying as if she trod on air. The old
woman was resting very comfortably in bed, her eyes
calm and bright, and a faint streak of the old apple-red
beginning to show itself upon her cheek. The
good chance for her recovery was a still better one
this morning.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s coming back again this morning,&#8217; she
whispered in Kate&#8217;s ear; &#8216;they let him stay beside
me all yesterday, and he&#8217;s coming back again to-day.
It&#8217;s a beautiful Christmas this is; I never knew one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
like it. I hope they&#8217;ll never catch that poor raskill
as shot me, I do. It &#8217;ud spoil my Christmas and
Johnny&#8217;s if they did. Has it been a happy Christmas
for you, my dear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very happy,&#8217; answered Kate, with a bright smile,
as the present joy blotted out the remembrance of the
past sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s right, my dear!&#8217; murmured Mrs. Duffy,
&#8216;I don&#8217;t know as ever I knew such a Christmas.&#8217;</p>

<p>There is little more to be told. Dr. Carey made
his appearance at Dr. Layard&#8217;s that evening, and
delighted him beyond measure by asking him for
Kate. Mrs. Duffy recovered and lived two or three
years longer in undisturbed happiness, and in a
degree of comfort to which she had been unaccustomed
throughout her life. For her son, who had
not prospered much in Australia, worked industriously
and steadily to maintain her at home, and
devoted himself to her with real tenderness. It was
not till after her death, when Kate Carey was standing
beside her coffin looking down at the placid face and
closed eyes of the old woman, that he told the story
of his return home.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d worked my passage across, ma&#8217;am,&#8217; he said,
the tears rolling down his cheeks, &#8216;and I&#8217;d landed in
Liverpool a week afore Christmas, with as much as
five pound in my pocket, all I&#8217;d saved in Australy;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
and there were a lot set on me, and took me to a
public, and I suppose I drank all my wits away. I
reached Ilverton by the last train on Christmas Eve,
but I didn&#8217;t know as mother were gone to live in
the town. It were a bitter night, and I slept on a
bench at the railway station. I hadn&#8217;t a penny left,
when I set out to seek mother; and I were wandering
about very miserable, when I saw a decent old
woman coming along all alone. I only thought I&#8217;d
frighten a shilling out of her. I never meant no
harm. The pistol were an old pistol I&#8217;d had in the
bush; and I didn&#8217;t recollect it was loaded, and it
went bursting off, all in an instant of time. That
quite brought me to, and I were running away to find
somebody, when I see you and the doctor coming.
I seemed to know it were a doctor. But when I
found out it were my own poor old mother, which I
did face to face with her in the hospital, I felt as I
should die. She never knew as it were me, never.
She used to talk about him, and say, &#8220;I forgave him,
Johnny, and I hope God has forgave him too, whoever
he is.&#8221; I shall never see another woman like my
poor old mother.&#8217;</p>

will eagerly open the pages, and not willingly close them, of the pretty volume.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>&#8216;English readers now have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with eleven
Polish and eight Bohemian stories, as well as with eight Russian and thirteen Servian,
in Mr. Naake&#8217;s modest but serviceable collection of Slavonic Fairy Tales. Its contents
are, as a general rule, well chosen, and they are translated with a fidelity which deserves
cordial praise.... Before taking leave of his prettily got up volume, we ought to
mention that its contents fully come up to the promise held out in its preface.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
